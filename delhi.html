<img src="d1.jpg" width=100% height=500><br><br>
<div>Qutub Minar is a minaret or a victory tower located in Mehrauli area of Delhi. With the height of 72.5 metres (238 ft), the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Qutub Minar is the second tallest monument of Delhi. Its construction was started in 1192 by Qutb Ud-Din-Aibak, founder of Delhi Sultanate after he defeated the last Hindu Ruler of Delhi. He constructed the basement, after which the construction was taken over by his son-in-law and successor Iltutmish who constructed three additional stories. The fourth and fifth storeys were built by Firoz Shah Tuglak.

Besides Qutub Minar, the Qutub Complex has many other ancient structures:

1. Quwwat-ul-Islam mosque: Built by Qutb-ud-din Aibak, founder of the Mamluk or Slave dynasty, this was the first mosque of India. It was constructed from the parts of the Hindu and Jain temples which were destroyed under the Islamic rule.  
2. Alai Darwaza: It is the main gateway from the southern side of the Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque. Built by the second Ala-ud-din Khilji in 1311 AD, it is an important structure of Delhi. It has domes decorated with red sandstone and white marbles.
3. Iron Pillar: The pillar was constructed by Chandragupta II Vikramaditya. It is 7.21-metre high and weighs more than six tonnes. The fascinating fact about the Iron Pillar is that it has not been rusted since the day it was erected.  
Another striking feature of the Qutub Complex is the Tomb of Iltutmish who was the second Sultan of Delhi. In the centre of the tomb, the main cenotaph of white marble is placed on a raised platform. It has awe-inspiring Islamic architecture.
4. Alai Minar: Alauddin Khilji started building the Alai Minar and wanted it to be two times higher than Qutub Minar. However, after his death in 1316, the monument was never completed by his successors. The first storey of the Alai Minar still stands today at Qutub Complex.

Besides these structures, you will find other captivating monuments like the Tomb of Adham Khan, Moti Masjid and Zafar Mahal.

<div>As the name suggests, Humayun's tomb is the final resting place of the Mughal Emperor Humayun. Located in the Nizamuddin East area of Delhi, it is the first garden-tomb in the Indian subcontinent. This splendid piece of architecture was commissioned for construction by Humayun's chief consort Empress Bega Begum in the year 1569-70 and is one of the very few structures that used red sandstone on such a massive scale at that time.</div>
